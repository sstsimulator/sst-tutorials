Example project for creating a component for SST

Created for SST-Core Version (9.1.0)  
Also works with SST-Core v10.0.0

This is a very simple component.  All it does is register a clock and
count the number of times the clock event handler is called.  When the
handler is called the specified number of times the simulation ends.
